# Toggle
This is a fork of [toggle.vim](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=895),
but with `<Leader>b` as the default normal-mode map for toggling words, and with
some other minor changes.





# Installation
Install with your favorite [plugin manager](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/388/what-is-the-difference-between-the-vim-plugin-managers).
I highly recommend the [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) manager,
in which case you can install this plugin by adding
```
Plug 'lukelbd/vim-toggle'
```
to your `~/.vimrc`.
